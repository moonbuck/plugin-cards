# Preview Card Creation Parameters
##################################

# Whether to replace links whose search parameters include 'QueryParameter'
# with a preview card  generated by scraping the linked page for Twitter / 
# Open Graph tags. When set to true, and given a 'QueryParameter' value of 
# 'cardify', a link like
#  <a href="https://my.blog/2021/11/29/my-post.html?cardify">whatever</a>
# would be replaced with a preview card by the cardify.js script.
#
QueryMatch = true

# Whether to automatically replace any link for a site page with a 
# preview card generated by scraping the linked page for 
# Twitter / Open Graph tags. Exactly which links are replaced with
# cards may be controlled via the Card.HostMatch parameters.
#
# When set to true, a link like
#   <a href="https://my.blog/2021/11/29/my-post.html>whatever</a>
# may be eligible for preview card replacement depending on how 
# the Card.HostMatch parameters have been configured.
#
HostMatch = false

# A regular expression for whitelisting which links are eligible
# for automatic replacement. This is applied on top of the CSS
# selection. 
#
# The value '.*.html' would exclude category pages, for example.
#
URLFilter = '.*'

# Whether links matched via query parameter should be cardified even when
# they do not match the 'URLFilter' regular expression.
QueryMatchOverridesFilter = true

# Parameters for preview cards created automatically when the link 
# points to another page of the Hugo generated site.
##################################################################

# A CSS selector specifying the links used by post summaries. This is
# used to exclude such links from generating preview cards.
#
ReadMoreLink = '.read-more'

# A CSS selector that leads right up to the <a> tags that should be 
# eligible for automatic replacement in post lists. This becomes 
# part of the final host match selector.
#
ListSandbox = '.post-body'

# A CSS selector that leads right up to the <a> tags that should be 
# eligible for automatic replacement in post pages. This becomes 
# part of the final host match selector.
#
PageSandbox = '#post-body'

# A custom CSS selector to use in place of the that which would be
# generated using the three parameter values above.
# 
# Given the default values
#
#   ReadMoreLink = '.read-more'
#   ListSandbox = '.post-body'
#   PageSandbox = '#post-body'
#
# and a site.BaseURL equal to https://my.blog
#
# the default value of the host match selector (shown split
# across multiple lines in invalid CSS syntax for clarity) 
# would be:
#
#   #post-body a[href*="my.blog" i]
#      :not(.cardify-card-link)
#      :not([href$="cardify"]),
#
#   .post-body a[href*="my.blog" i]
#      :not(.read-more)
#      :not(.cardify-card-link)
#      :not([href$="cardify"])
#
# Setting this value to a non-empty string will completely replace the
# default selector with the custom selector value.

CustomSelector = ''
