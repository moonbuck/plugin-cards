# Whether to replace links whose search parameters include 'QueryParameter'
# with a preview card  generated by scraping the linked page for Twitter / 
# Open Graph tags. When set to true, and given a 'QueryParameter' value of 
# 'cardify', a link like
#  <a href="https://my.blog/2021/11/29/my-post.html?cardify">whatever</a>
# would be replaced with a preview card by the cardify.js script.
#
QueryMatch = true

# Whether to automatically replace any link for a site page with a 
# preview card generated by scraping the linked page for 
# Twitter / Open Graph tags. Exactly which links are replaced with
# cards may be controlled via the Card.HostMatch parameters.
#
# When set to true, a link like
#   <a href="https://my.blog/2021/11/29/my-post.html>whatever</a>
# may be eligible for preview card replacement depending on how 
# the Card.HostMatch parameters have been configured.
#
HostMatch = false

# A regular expression for whitelisting which links are eligible
# for automatic replacement. This is applied on top of the CSS
# selection. 
#
# The value '.*.html' would exclude category pages, for example.
#
URLFilter = '.*'

# Whether links matched via query parameter should be cardified even when
# they do not match the 'URLFilter' regular expression.
