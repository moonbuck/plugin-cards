# A CSS selector specifying the links used by post summaries. This is
# used to exclude such links from generating preview cards.
#
ReadMoreLink = '.read-more'

# A CSS selector that leads right up to the <a> tags that should be 
# eligible for automatic replacement in post lists. This becomes 
# part of the final host match selector.

ListSandbox = '.post-body'

# A CSS selector that leads right up to the <a> tags that should be 
# eligible for automatic replacement in post pages. This becomes 
# part of the final host match selector.
#
PageSandbox = '#post-body'

# A custom CSS selector to use in place of the that which would be
# generated using the three parameter values above.
# 
# Given the default values
#
#   ReadMoreLink = '.read-more'
#   ListSandbox = '.post-body'
#   PageSandbox = '#post-body'
#
# and a site.BaseURL equal to https://my.blog
#
# the default value of the host match selector (shown split
# across multiple lines in invalid CSS syntax for clarity) 
# would be:
#
#   #post-body a[href*="my.blog" i]
#      :not(.cardify-card-link)
#      :not([href$="cardify"]),
#
#   .post-body a[href*="my.blog" i]
#      :not(.read-more)
#      :not(.cardify-card-link)
#      :not([href$="cardify"])
#
# Setting this value to a non-empty string will completely replace the
# default selector with the custom selector value.
